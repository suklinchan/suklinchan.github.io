        <h1>Where Are the Worst Drivers in US</h1>
      </center>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">
      To understand which state has the worst drivers, we need to look at multiple factors. The number of collisions alone is not a sufficient indicator of the prevalence of bad driving. We need to factor in the total miles traveled in each state and focus on the characteristics of the drivers who were involved in fatal collisions. The cost of auto insurance could also reflect quality of driving in a state. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      In this narrative visualization, you will examine several measures which could be indicators of bad driving: number of car crashes in each state, and out of these, those associated with bad driving behaviors: speeding, alcohol impairment, distractions, and involvement in previous accidents, and finally, how much insurance companies charge drivers. You can check out if there is any relationship between the driving behaviors and the total number of collisions. You will be analyzing data from the year 2012 for this exercise. Your observations could differ with data for a different year.
